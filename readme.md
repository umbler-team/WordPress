## First Things First

Welcome. WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I’m proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we’re dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.

— Matt Mullenweg

## Updating

### Using the Automatic Updater

If you are updating from version 2.7 or higher, you can use the automatic updater:

1.  Open [wp-admin/update-core.php](wp-admin/update-core.php) in your browser and follow the instructions.
2.  You wanted more, perhaps? That’s it!

### Updating Manually

1.  Before you update anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as `index.php`.
2.  Delete your old WordPress files, saving ones you’ve modified.
3.  Upload the new files.
4.  Point your browser to [/wp-admin/upgrade.php](wp-admin/upgrade.php).

## Migrating from other systems

The Codex is the encyclopedia of all things WordPress. It is the most comprehensive source of information for WordPress available.

[The WordPress Blog](https://wordpress.org/news/)
This is where you’ll find the latest updates and news related to WordPress. Recent WordPress news appears in your administrative dashboard by default.

[WordPress Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/)
If you’ve looked everywhere and still can’t find an answer, the support forums are very active and have a large community ready to help. To help them help you be sure to use a descriptive thread title and describe your question in as much detail as possible.

[WordPress IRC Channel](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC)
There is an online chat channel that is used for discussion among people who use WordPress and occasionally support topics. The above wiki page should point you in the right direction. ([irc.freenode.net #wordpress](irc://irc.freenode.net/wordpress))



## Final Notes

*   If you have any suggestions, ideas, or comments, or if you (gasp!) found a bug, join us in the [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/).
*   WordPress has a robust plugin API that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this, see the [Plugin Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/). You shouldn’t modify any of the core code.

## Share the Love

WordPress has no multi-million dollar marketing campaign or celebrity sponsors, but we do have something even better—you. If you enjoy WordPress please consider telling a friend, setting it up for someone less knowledgable than yourself, or writing the author of a media article that overlooks us.

WordPress is the official continuation of [b2/cafélog](http://cafelog.com/), which came from Michel V. The work has been continued by the [WordPress developers](https://wordpress.org/about/). If you would like to support WordPress, please consider [donating](https://wordpress.org/donate/ "Donate to WordPress").
